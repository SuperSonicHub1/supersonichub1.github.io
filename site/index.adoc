= Kyle Anthony Williams Computer Company
Kyle Williams <kyle.anthony.williams2@gmail.com>

This is the humble hompage of Kyle Anthony Williams, a computer scientist
and electrical engineer in training whose ideas walk the borderline of clever
and stupid.

This website acts primarily as a weblog, but also hosts links to
my presence on the rest of the internet as well as personal metadata
which I'd like to share.

This site isn't the prettiest thing at the moment, but that's because I'm
developing a good chunk of it from scratch in
https://github.com/supersonichub1/supersonichub1.github.io/[the open]
with https://www.11ty.dev/[11ty]!
I actually like simpler designs like this anyway, so the site's going to look like
this for the forseeable future.
