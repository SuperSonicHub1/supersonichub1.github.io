Here are a few things you may want to know about me:

* I go by he/him/his pronouns.
* I study electrical engineering and computer science at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and plan to graduate with a Bachelors
of Science in May 2027.
* My main interests in no particular order include computer science,
mathematics, physics, linguistics, music theory, and creative writing.
* For fun, I like playing video games, reading books, brainstorming
large software projects, and aimlessly walking down city roads.
