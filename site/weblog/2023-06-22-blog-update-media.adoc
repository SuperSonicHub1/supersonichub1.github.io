== Blog Update: Media Support!

The KAWCCO website now supports images and has theoretical support for audio and video!
This is implemented identically to CSS in my site with 11ty's https://www.11ty.dev/docs/copy/["Passthrough File Copy"] feature.
Images and other media go in the `media` folder, nested in folders that match the path of the page they're featured in.
See it in action with link:/weblog/2023-06-22-feed-deduplication/["Feed Deduplication."]
