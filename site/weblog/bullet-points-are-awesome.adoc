= Bullet Points Are Awesome!

People are always telling me to write formally when trying to ``think
out'' something, but that doesn’t really work for me. I very much prefer
using bullet points to convey my ideas, as I love their semi-structured
nature. In fact, I enjoy them so much that the rest of this is going to
be in bullet points!

* bullet points have structure
** second level
*** third level
**** fourth, should probably never go here
* quotes are easy
** ``I got, I got, I got, I got— / Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA''
*** Kendrick Lamar, ``DNA.''
* thoughts just flow out of me naturally
* it’s just a steady stream of consciousness
* you want a list? just make one
** bread
** oranges
** milk
* it’s very easy to give your writing footnotes
** << insert extra info here >>
* you shouldn’t use bullet points everywhere though
** essays are much better if your ideas have structure
** bullet points are much better suited to being inserted into an essay
when referring to a list
** block quotes are obviously much cleaner than bullet points
** can’t have media like images and videos
* bullet points are still awesome though, and you should definitely use
them to
** answer free writes
** do semi-structured brainstorming
** work out an algorithm
