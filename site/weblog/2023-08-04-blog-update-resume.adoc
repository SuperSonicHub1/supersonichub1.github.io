== Blog Update: I Have a Résumé Now

I generated a link:/resume.pdf[résumé] using https://europa.eu/europass/en[Europass].
I originally planned to create a CV using https://jsonresume.org/[JSON Resume],
but found composing a document, even with help from VS Code's JSON Schema support,
to be an underwhelming experience, and found the format to be simulataneously
too broad and too restrictive.
Europass is thankfully also an https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/search?keys=europass[open standard],
so I have no qualms about not being able to edit it in the future.
